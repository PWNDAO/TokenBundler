# Token Bundler

The contract enables to bundle ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155 into a single ERC1155 token. The contract is completely permissionless.
The only constrain is the array size which is set on contract deployment.

The owner of the bundle NFT token has rights to:
 - transfering ownership of the bundle token to another address
 - unwrap the entire bundle resulting in burning the bundle token and gaining ownership over the wrapped tokens
